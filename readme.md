# Project-M

This is a magic trick I learned from [a million card tricks](https://www.youtube.com/@AMillionCardTricks). I have modified it a bit so that it would fit the theme and my liking. I hope you enjoyed it.\
If you're interested in magic or want to know how the trick _generally_ works, you can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvXVT-ygx5k). However, be aware that once you know the magic behind it, **you can't _unknow_ it**. And it might make watching some tricks just a bit less magical.\
If you would like to run the website locally, on your computer, you can [download the zip file](https://github.com/S-M-T09k/project-M/releases/tag/v0.0.2) I provided, unzip the files and run the `index.html` file.\
I had fun building this website and working on this project even though I spent more time than I would have liked. However, it was an amazing experience nonetheless. I did add some things last minute and I hope it turns out great. I would like to thank [tr Hat Zaw Htoo](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064739377176) for planning this project.\
I did not make everything you see. You can find the appropriate credits attached to the _stolen things_. If _you_ would like to get into programming, I suggest you try one of the courses below it can be a lot of fun and who knows, you might get a new hobby.
